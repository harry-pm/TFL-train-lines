# AIM

To build simple app that fetches and displays the status of the different train lines using TFL's API.

# User stories

- As a user I want to be able to search for a train line in order to see it's status.

- As a user I would like a colour theme that relates to the colour of the train line of which I am searching.

- As a user I would like the page to update regualrly if I leave the page idle.

- As a user I would like to be able to see when the information was last updated

# Strech goals

- Have login authentication 

- Once users can login, allow them to choose favourite lines which are presented on the home page without having to search for the line.
